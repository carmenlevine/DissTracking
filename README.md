Tracking criminal behaviour using mobile phones

This project includes the development of an application called Android Tracker.

Android Tracker extracts the location of the device and presents it in the form of latitude and longitude on the user interface. Once the submit location button is clicked, the application sends the latitude and longitude to a PHP script, which that inputs the data into a database called locationtracker inside a table called location_history, which allocates a unique identification key and a current timestamp.
It was created using Android Studio, XAMPP and phpMyAdmin.

This project was developed as part of the Project unit for project RC.171 Tracking criminal behaviour using mobile phones at Manchester Metropolitan Unversity by Carmen Mae Levine, student number 18003552.
